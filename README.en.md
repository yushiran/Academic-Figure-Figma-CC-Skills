Upstream figure pipelines ([studio-pro](https://github.com/c-narcissus/paper-framework-figure-studio-pro), [PaperBanana](https://github.com/llmsresearch/paperbanana)) produce raster candidates — great for exploring layout, impossible to hand-tune. This skill lets **Claude Code drive Figma directly through the official Figma MCP server**, landing a candidate or sketch as the final **editable, paper-exact vector figure**: true print width, true vector icons, every label audited against the paper source.

## 🎬 Live demo

No human intervention: skeleton → three parallel fill calls → one assembly pass laying 25 end-to-end arrows → screenshot self-review, which caught two memory arrows piercing the cross-attention block and rerouted them.

## ✅ Capability matrix

## 🚀 Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yushiran/Academic-Figure-Figma-CC-Skills.git
cp -r Academic-Figure-Figma-CC-Skills/academic-figure-figma ~/.claude/skills/
claude plugin install figma@claude-plugins-official   # OAuth steps: references/figma-mcp-setup.md
```

Then ask Claude Code: **"Rebuild this framework figure in Figma at IEEE double-column width."**
